# Basic layout

- Hero text \["Software Engineer","Mechanical Engineer","Electrical Engineer"] is similar to [voidzero](https://voidzero.dev/)
- Hero text end point is a floaty version of my logo. Maybe shifts colors.
- Entrance animation for hero section similar to [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
- Scroll mechanic of zig zagging dot that goes through the section borders. Always zig zags.
- Animation similar to Powered by section of [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) pulses from the center of my logo in the hero section(header??). Create cool animation for that. Charging up animation with different colors.
- Section layout from [voidzero](https://voidzero.dev/)

# Background effect

- Similar to NEXTJS 15 section for [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) with game of life effect.
- Similar to [voidzero](https://voidzero.dev/) lines where the lines are illuminated with a gol effect.
- Maybe gradient from [vercel](https://vercel.com/)
